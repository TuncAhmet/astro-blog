# Pointers

## Introduction to Pointers

### \***\*Assigning addresses to Pointers\*\***

Let's take an example.

```c
int* pc, c;
c = 5;
pc = &c;
```

Here, 5 is assigned to theÂ cÂ variable. And, the address ofÂ cÂ is assigned to theÂ pcÂ pointer.

### \***\*Get Value of Thing Pointed by Pointers\*\***

To get the value of the thing pointed by the pointers, we use theÂ `*`Â operator. For example:

```c
int* pc, c;
c = 5;
pc = &c;
printf("%d", *pc);   // Output: 5
```

Here, the address ofÂ `c`
Â is assigned to theÂ pc
Â pointer. To get the value stored in that address, we usedÂ \*pc
.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ **Note:**Â In the above example,Â pcÂ is a pointer, notÂ `*pc`. You cannot and should not do something likeÂ `*pc = &c`;

By the way,Â `*`Â is called the dereference operator (when working with pointers). It operates on a pointer and gives the value stored in that pointer.

</aside>

### \***\*Common mistakes when working with pointers\*\***

Suppose, you want pointerÂ pcÂ to point to the address ofÂ c. Then,

```c
int c, *pc;

// pc is address but c is not
pc = c;  // Error

// &c is address but *pc is not
*pc = &c;  // Error

// both &c and pc are addresses
pc = &c;  // Not an error

// both c and *pc are values
*pc = c;  // Not an error
```

## Pointers & Arrays

### **Relationship Between Arrays and Pointers**

An array is a block of sequential data. Let's write a program to print addresses of array elements.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
   int x[4];
   int i;

   for(i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
      printf("&x[%d] = %p\n", i, &x[i]);
   }

   printf("Address of array x: %p", x);

   return 0;
}
```

Output

```c
&x[0] = 1450734448
&x[1] = 1450734452
&x[2] = 1450734456
&x[3] = 1450734460
Address of array x: 1450734448
```

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Notice that, the address ofÂ &x[0] andÂ x is the same. It's because the variable nameÂ x points to the first element of the array.

## Pointers & Functions

### **Example: Pass Addresses to Functions**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
void swap(int *n1, int *n2);

int main()
{
    int num1 = 5, num2 = 10;

    // address of num1 and num2 is passed
    swap( &num1, &num2);

    printf("num1 = %d\n", num1); // 10
    printf("num2 = %d", num2); // 5
    return 0;
}

void swap(int* n1, int* n2)
{
    int temp;
    temp = *n1;
    *n1 = *n2;
    *n2 = temp;
}
```

WhenÂ *n1Â andÂ *n2Â are changed inside theÂ `swap()`Â function,Â num1Â andÂ num2Â inside theÂ main()Â function are also changed.

Inside theÂ `swap()`Â function,Â `*n1`Â andÂ `*n2`Â swapped. Hence,Â num1Â andÂ num2Â are also swapped.

Notice thatÂ `swap()`Â is not returning anything; its return type isÂ `void`.

## **Example 2: Passing Pointers to Functions**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void addOne(int* ptr) {
  (*ptr)++; // adding 1 to *ptr
}

int main()
{
  int* p, i = 10;
  p = &i;
  addOne(p);

  printf("%d", *p); // 11
  return 0;
}
```

Here, the value stored atÂ p,Â `*p`, is 10 initially.

We then passed the pointerÂ pÂ to theÂ `addOne()`Â function. TheÂ ptrÂ pointer gets this address in theÂ `addOne()`Â function.

Inside the function, we increased the value stored atÂ ptrÂ by 1 usingÂ `(*ptr)++;`. SinceÂ ptrÂ andÂ pÂ pointers both have the same address,Â `*p`Â insideÂ `main()`Â is also 11.

## **C Dynamic Memory Allocation**

As you know, an array is a collection of a fixed number of values. Once the size of an array is declared, you cannot change it.

Sometimes the size of the array you declared may be insufficient. To solve this issue, you can allocate memory manually during run-time. This is known as dynamic memory allocation in C programming.

To allocate memory dynamically, library functions areÂ `malloc()`,Â `calloc()`,Â `realloc()`Â andÂ `free()`Â are used. These functions are defined in theÂ `<stdlib.h>`Â header file.

### C Malloc()

The name "malloc" stands for memory allocation.

TheÂ `malloc()`Â function reserves a block of memory of the specified number of bytes. And, it returns aÂ [pointer](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/c-pointers)Â ofÂ `void`Â which can be casted into pointers of any form.

\***\*Syntax of malloc()\*\***

```c
ptr = (castType*) malloc(size);
```

example

```c
ptr = (float*) malloc(100 * sizeof(float));
```

The above statement allocates 400 bytes of memory. It's because the size ofÂ `float`Â is 4 bytes. And, the pointerÂ ptrÂ holds the address of the first byte in the allocated memory.

The expression results in aÂ `NULL`Â pointer if the memory cannot be allocated.

### **C calloc()**

The name "calloc" stands for contiguous allocation.

TheÂ `malloc()`Â function allocates memory and leaves the memory uninitialized, whereas theÂ `calloc()`Â function allocates memory and initializes all bits to zero.

\***\*Syntax of calloc()\*\***

```c
ptr = (castType*)calloc(n, size);
```

example

```c
ptr = (float*) calloc(25, sizeof(float));
```

The above statement allocates contiguous space in memory for 25 elements of typeÂ `float`.

### **C free()**

Dynamically allocated memory created with eitherÂ `calloc()`Â orÂ `malloc()`Â doesn't get freed on their own. You must explicitly useÂ `free()`Â to release the space.

\***\*Syntax of free()\*\***

```c
free(ptr);
```

This statement frees the space allocated in the memory pointed byÂ `ptr`.

\***\*Example 1: malloc() and free()\*\***

```c
// Program to calculate the sum of n numbers entered by the user

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
  int n, i, *ptr, sum = 0;

  printf("Enter number of elements: ");
  scanf("%d", &n);

  ptr = (int*) malloc(n * sizeof(int));

  // if memory cannot be allocated
  if(ptr == NULL) {
    printf("Error! memory not allocated.");
    exit(0);
  }

  printf("Enter elements: ");
  for(i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    scanf("%d", ptr + i);
    sum += *(ptr + i);
  }

  printf("Sum = %d", sum);

  // deallocating the memory
  free(ptr);

  return 0;
}
```

\***\*Example 2: calloc() and free()\*\***

```c
// Program to calculate the sum of n numbers entered by the user

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
  int n, i, *ptr, sum = 0;
  printf("Enter number of elements: ");
  scanf("%d", &n);

  ptr = (int*) calloc(n, sizeof(int));
  if(ptr == NULL) {
    printf("Error! memory not allocated.");
    exit(0);
  }

  printf("Enter elements: ");
  for(i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    scanf("%d", ptr + i);
    sum += *(ptr + i);
  }

  printf("Sum = %d", sum);
  free(ptr);
  return 0;
}
```

### **C realloc()**

If the dynamically allocated memory is insufficient or more than required, you can change the size of previously allocated memory using theÂ `realloc()`
Â function.

\***\*Syntax of realloc()\*\***

```c
ptr = realloc(ptr,x);
```

Here,Â ptr is reallocated with a new sizeÂ x.

\***\*Example 3: realloc()\*\***

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
  int *ptr, i , n1, n2;
  printf("Enter size: ");
  scanf("%d", &n1);

  ptr = (int*) malloc(n1 * sizeof(int));

  printf("Addresses of previously allocated memory:\n");
  for(i = 0; i < n1; ++i)
    printf("%pc\n",ptr + i);

  printf("\nEnter the new size: ");
  scanf("%d", &n2);

  // rellocating the memory
  ptr = realloc(ptr, n2 * sizeof(int));

  printf("Addresses of newly allocated memory:\n");
  for(i = 0; i < n2; ++i)
    printf("%pc\n", ptr + i);

  free(ptr);

  return 0;
}
```
